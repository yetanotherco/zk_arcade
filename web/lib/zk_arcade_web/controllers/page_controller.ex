The beasts are attracted to the player's (◄►) position every move. The beginning levels have only the common beasts, however in later levels the more challenging super-beasts appear (╟╢). These super-beasts are harder to kill as they must be crushed against a static block (▓▓).",

        1. Install Rust by following the official guide: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
        2. Install the RiscZero toolchain: https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/install
        3. Clone the zk_arcade repository using: <span class="code-block">git clone https://github.com/yetanotherco/aligned_layer.git</span>
        4. Run the game with the command: <span class="code-block">make play_beast</span>
        5. Locate the generated proof file on your system
        6. Upload your proof to verify your gameplay
        7. After the proof is verified on <span class="text-accent-100">ALIGNED</span>, come back later to submit it to the leaderboard contract to earn points.

        Important notes about proof submissions:

      - You can only submit <span class="text-accent-100">one proof per level</span>. For example, if you've reached level 5 and then try to submit a proof for level 4, it will fail.
      - Each submission must be for a level <span class="text-accent-100">higher than any previously submitted proof</span>. So, if you've already submitted level 5, your next valid submission must be at least level 6.
      - Points are awarded <span class="text-accent-100">per level</span>, not cumulatively. The best strategy is to submit a proof when you’re confident you won’t reach higher levels or after completing the entire game.
